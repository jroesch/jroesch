#Hello, World!
Finally after saying I would finish my website forever and ever, I finally have. This is just a welcome post saying this
thing is running, and letting my friends who have been giving me a hard time(ahem, Andrew). That I did in fact get my
site working when summer started. Its very much a work in progress this is my first few days effort. I'll be hacking 
on it some more, and adding things like tags, and search, ect. as the days come, and hopefully posting some of those
writeups I have lying around.
